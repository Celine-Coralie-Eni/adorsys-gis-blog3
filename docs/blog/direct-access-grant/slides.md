# Direct Access Grant Flow
## Resource Owner Password Credentials

---

## What is Direct Access Grant?

OAuth 2.0 grant type for **highly trusted applications**

- **Resource Owner** (User) provides credentials directly to **Client** (Application)
- No browser redirects or authorization screens
- Simple authentication flow with fewer steps
- Designed for first-party applications only

```mermaid

  A[Resource Owner] --> B[Client]
  B --> C[Authorization Server]
  C --> D[Resource Server]
```

## OAuth 2.0 Components Explained

### The Four Key Players:

- **👤 Resource Owner** = The User (person who owns the data)
- **📱 Client** = The Application (mobile app, desktop app)
- **🏛️ Authorization Server** = Identity Provider (Keycloak, Auth0)
- **🌐 Resource Server** = Backend API (holds protected resources)

*In our context: User logs into a mobile app to access their profile data from a backend service*

---

## Advantages & Disadvantages

### ✅ **Advantages:**
- **Simple Implementation** - Fewer steps than other OAuth flows
- **No Browser Required** - Perfect for mobile and CLI applications
- **Direct User Experience** - Users stay within the application
- **Legacy System Friendly** - Easy migration from basic auth

### ❌ **Disadvantages:**
- **Security Risk** - Client handles user passwords
- **Limited Trust Model** - Only for highly trusted applications
- **No Consent Screen** - Users can't review permissions
- **Credential Exposure** - Passwords transmitted to client

---

## Step 1: Credential Collection

**Resource Owner** (User) enters credentials into **Client** (Application)

**What happens:** 
- User opens the trusted application
- Application presents a login interface
- User enters their username and password directly
- User trusts the application with their credentials

**Key Point:** This requires complete trust between user and application

---

## Step 2: Authentication Request

**Client** (Application) sends credentials to **Authorization Server** (Keycloak)

The client application collects:
- User's username and password
- Client's own identification credentials
- Requested access scopes

```mermaid
graph LR
  A[Client] -->|Send Credentials| B[Authorization Server]
```

**Key Point:** Both user credentials and client credentials are validated

---

## Step 3: Validation & Token Issuance

**Authorization Server** (Keycloak) validates and issues tokens

**Validation Process:**
1. Verify client identity and permissions
2. Authenticate user credentials
3. Check if client is allowed to use Direct Access Grant
4. Generate access and refresh tokens

```mermaid
graph LR
  A[Authorization Server] -->|Return Tokens| B[Client]
```

**Result:** Client receives tokens to access protected resources

---

## Step 4: Resource Access

**Client** (Application) uses token to access **Resource Server** (Backend API)

The client application:
- Includes access token in request headers
- Requests protected user data
- Receives authorized information

```mermaid
graph LR
  A[Client] -->|Bearer Token| B[Resource Server]
  B -->|Protected Data| A
```

**Final Step:** User sees their data displayed in the application

---

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant RO as Resource Owner
  participant C as Client
  participant AS as Authorization Server
  participant RS as Resource Server

  RO->>C: Enter credentials
  C->>AS: Send credentials + client_id
  AS->>AS: Validate client & user
  AS->>C: Return access_token
  C->>RS: Request data with token
  RS->>RS: Validate token
  RS->>C: Return protected data
  C->>RO: Display user data
```

## When to Use Direct Access Grant

### ✅ **Recommended Scenarios:**
- **📱 First-party mobile apps** - Your organization's own applications
- **💻 Command-line tools** - Developer utilities and scripts
- **🔄 Legacy system migration** - Transitioning from basic authentication
- **🏢 Internal enterprise apps** - High-trust corporate environments

### ❌ **Avoid These Scenarios:**
- **🌐 Third-party applications** - External developer applications
- **🖥️ Web applications** - Browser-based apps (use Authorization Code)
- **🔓 Public clients** - Apps that cannot securely store secrets
- **📱 App store applications** - Downloaded by unknown users

---

## Security Best Practices

### 🔴 **Key Risks:**
- User credentials exposed to client application
- No granular permission consent
- Potential for credential theft or misuse
- Difficult to audit access patterns

### 🛡️ **Essential Mitigations:**
- Use **only with highly trusted** first-party clients
- Implement **HTTPS everywhere** - never use HTTP
- Configure **short token lifetimes** (5-15 minutes)
- Enable **strong client authentication**
- Conduct **regular security audits** and monitoring
- Consider **alternative flows** for better security
